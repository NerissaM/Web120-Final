<h2>How does Placing an Order Work?</h2><p>We use a google form to track our orders. <a href= "https://forms.gle/v9Rvu5gTA9bhFycn6">The ordering form can be accessed here!</a>
<p>We host two pickups a month, with three pickup locations, for your convenience. Once you place your order an electronic invoice will be sent to you and your pickup instructions will be given to you based on the location you selected.</p> 
<p>All orders need to be prepaid. Unpaid orders will not be placed with our suppliers and you will not get your products. The Co Op will place orders for exactly whats been purchased, so please plan ahead.</p></p>
